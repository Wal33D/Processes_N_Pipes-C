# 🔄 Processes-N-Pipes: Case Inversion IPC Demo

Welcome to **Processes-N-Pipes**, an educational and entertaining exploration into the realms of inter-process communication (IPC) using ordinary pipes. This specialized toolkit demonstrates a simple yet intriguing use case: sending a string message between two processes where the receiving process inversely cases each character and sends it back. Perfect for learners and educators, this project simplifies understanding IPC through a fun, interactive example.

## 🎯 Core Functionality

- **Case Inversion via Pipes**: Discover the power of pipes in IPC by sending a message from one process to another, which then inversely cases each character and replies back.
- **Two-Way Communication**: Utilizes two pipes, one for each direction of communication, to showcase how messages can flow between processes efficiently.
- **Educational Tool**: Designed as a learning aid to demonstrate IPC mechanics in a clear, engaging manner.

## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Prepare for this IPC journey with:
- A GCC compiler or any standard C compiler.
- Basic terminal operations.

### Installation & Compilation

Ensure your project directory is structured with `main.c` and `utilities.c` inside the `/src` folder, and `utilities.h` inside the `/include` folder.

1. **Clone this repository**:
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Processes-N-Pipes.git
    \`\`\`

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    \`\`\`bash
    cd Processes-N-Pipes
    \`\`\`

3. **Compile the project using the Makefile**:
    \`\`\`bash
    make
    \`\`\`
This will compile the source files from the `/src` directory and place the executable in the `/bin` directory as defined in the Makefile.

## 📘 How to Play

After compiling, simply run the executable with a message as an argument to see the case inversion process in action:

\`\`\`bash
./bin/myprogram "Hi There!"
\`\`\`

You'll observe that the message sent to the second process comes back with each of its character's case inverted, for example, "Hi There!" becomes "hI tHERE!".

## 🌟 Demonstration

This project illustrates the essential principles of IPC using a straightforward case inversion example:

- **Process 1 (Parent)** sends "Hi There!" to **Process 2 (Child)**.
- **Process 2 (Child)** receives the message, inverts the case, and sends "hI tHERE!" back to **Process 1 (Parent)**.

### Dive Into the Mechanics

The program employs two pipes:
- One for transmitting the original message from Process 1 to Process 2.
- Another for delivering the case-inverted message from Process 2 back to Process 1.
